# Background
Writing and collecting gists is a good way of learning programming and preparing useful bullets for future projects, yet one pain-point for some popular online gist websites such as [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) is that it doesn't have a gist beautify feature as in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net). This is particularly painful for programming who values the visual style of his gists.

To solve this problem, I've developed this chrome extension serving to beautify the gist codes on popular gist websites such as [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), [app.gistboxapp.com](https://app.gistboxapp.com/).

# Usage
1. Enable this extension in your chrome.
2. Navigated to the edit page of your gist on [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) or [app.gistboxapp.com](https://app.gistboxapp.com/).
3. Select the code inside the editor that your want to beautify, Copy it, then a banner with a button should be showing.
4. Click the button then you will have your code beautified and copied, you can Paste it to wherever you want.
